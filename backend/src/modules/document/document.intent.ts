 * Two-stage detection for "the user wants a document out of this".

 *   Stage 1 — a free regex gate with high recall and deliberately poor
 *             precision. It has NO authority to trigger generation; it only
 *             decides whether stage 2 is worth paying for. ~95% of messages
 *             stop here at zero cost.
 *
 *   Stage 2 — a cheap model call that judges actual intent. This is what
 *             separates "make me a PDF of that" from "how do I generate a PDF
 *             in Node?" — a distinction no keyword list can draw, and the
 *             false positive that would most damage trust in the feature.
 *
 * Everything here fails open: any error, timeout or malformed reply resolves
 * to NONE and the chat proceeds untouched. An optional feature must never be
 * able to break the conversation.

Reply with ONLY this JSON object:
{
  "intent": "REPLACE" | "AUGMENT" | "NONE",
  "format": ${DOCUMENT_FORMATS.map((f) => `"${f}"`).join(" | ")},
  "title": string,            // short document title, "" when intent is NONE
  "useLastAnswer": boolean,   // true if the document should be built from the previous assistant answer
  "confidence": number        // 0.0 - 1.0
}

Choosing "format" — report what the user ASKED FOR, never what you think is best:
- "PDF"  — "pdf", or any request for a document/report/write-up with no format named. This is the default.
- "DOCX" — "word", "word file", "doc file", "docx", "editable document".
- "PPTX" — "ppt", "powerpoint", "pptx", "presentation", "slide deck", "slides".
- "XLSX" — "excel", "spreadsheet", "xlsx", "sheet", "csv".
When no format is named at all, answer "PDF".

Meaning of each intent:
- "REPLACE": the message ONLY asks for a file. Nothing else is being asked.
    "make me a PDF about X", "export that as a PDF", "put that in a document"
- "AUGMENT": the message asks a real question AND asks for a file.
    "explain microservices and give me a PDF", "compare these and send a report"
- "NONE": no file is being requested. This includes questions ABOUT documents,
    file formats, or how to build them in code.
    "how do I generate a PDF in Node?", "what is a PDF?", "why is my pdf library failing",
    "read this PDF and explain it", "summarise the attached document"

Critical distinctions:
- Asking the assistant to READ, SUMMARISE or EXPLAIN an existing document is NONE. Only asking it to CREATE a new file counts.
- A programming question that mentions PDFs is always NONE.
- "useLastAnswer" is true when the message refers to earlier content ("that", "this", "the above", "your answer") rather than naming a fresh topic.
- Be conservative. When genuinely unsure, answer NONE with low confidence.`;
